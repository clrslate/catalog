# Templates by Use Case

This index will organize ClrSlate templates by use case once templates are created based on actual capabilities documented in ClrSlate platform.

**REQUIREMENT**: All use cases listed here must be supported by capabilities documented in the ClrSlate platform specifications.

## Use Case Categories

Use cases will be determined by analyzing:
1. Actual capabilities described in ClrSlate platform documentation
2. Examples found in `Samples/model-definitions/`
3. Handler types available in `invocationHandlers/`

## Known Handler Capabilities (from ClrSlate platform)

### Console Handler
Based on `invocationHandlers/console.md`
- Use cases to be determined from actual handler documentation

### Tekton Pipeline Handler  
Based on `invocationHandlers/tekton-pipelineref.md`
- Use cases to be determined from actual handler documentation

## Development Guidelines

Use case categories should be:
1. Based on actual ClrSlate platform capabilities
2. Supported by existing handler implementations
3. Demonstrated in existing samples from `Samples/`
4. Aligned with model types documented in `ModelDefinition.md`

Avoid creating use case categories for capabilities not documented in the ClrSlate specifications.

*Templates and use case mappings to be developed based on ClrSlate platform analysis*
